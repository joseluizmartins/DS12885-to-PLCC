DS12885 DIP-24 to PLCC-28 Adapter

This project is an adapter designed to convert the DS12885 Real-Time Clock (RTC) chip from a DIP-24 package to a PLCC-28 package. The motivation behind this project stems from the unavailability of the DS12885 in Brazil and the high cost of importing it (almost triple the price in shipping and taxes).

The adapter not only solves the immediate need for using the DS12885 in PLCC-28 format but also serves as a foundation for future implementations, such as integration with Serguey Kiselev's RTC board.

This repository includes the design files, schematics, and necessary documentation to replicate or adapt the project for your own use. Contributions and improvements are welcome!
